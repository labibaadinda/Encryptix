# Encryptix - Machine Learning Internship Tasks

This repository contains the tasks completed during my Machine Learning internship at **Encryptix**. My name is **Labiba Adinda Zahwana**, and throughout this internship, I applied machine learning techniques to various real-world problems, including data preprocessing, model development, training, evaluation, and results reporting. Each task is organized in separate directories and documented accordingly.

## Project Overview

The `Encryptix` repository showcases my work during my internship. It includes code and reports for various machine learning tasks, such as movie genre classification, credit card fraud detection, customer churn prediction, spam SMS detection, and handwritten text generation. This repository demonstrates my ability to work with different machine learning models, data types, and evaluation techniques. The objective of this project is to apply machine learning algorithms to real-world problems and assess the performance of various models.

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Movie Genre Classification
**Objective:** Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information.
- **Directory:** `/task1_movie_genre_classification/`
- **Steps:**
  1. **Data Preprocessing:** Tokenize text, remove stop words, and apply text vectorization techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
  2. **Model Training:** Train a classification model using algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines (SVM).
  3. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

### Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
**Objective:** Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using transaction data.
- **Directory:** `/task2_credit_card_fraud_detection/`
- **Steps:**
  1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, normalize data, and split into training and test sets.
  2. **Model Training:** Experiment with classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests.
  3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

### Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction
**Objective:** Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business.
- **Directory:** `/task3_customer_churn_prediction/`
- **Steps:**
  1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the dataset by handling missing values, scaling features, and performing feature selection.
  2. **Model Training:** Build a classification model using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
  3. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.

### Task 4: Spam SMS Detection
**Objective:** Build a model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate.
- **Directory:** `/task4_spam_sms_detection/`
- **Steps:**
  1. **Data Preprocessing:** Tokenize the text data, remove stop words, and apply TF-IDF or word embeddings for text vectorization.
  2. **Model Training:** Train a classification model using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines (SVM).
  3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

### Task 5: Handwritten Text Generation
**Objective:** Implement a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate handwritten-like text.
- **Directory:** `/task5_handwritten_text_generation/`
- **Steps:**
  1. **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare a dataset of handwritten text samples and preprocess it for model input.
  2. **Model Training:** Train a character-level RNN to generate text similar to the handwriting examples.
  3. **Model Evaluation:** Generate text samples and evaluate the model based on the quality and coherence of the output.
