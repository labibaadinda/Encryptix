# Encryptix - Machine Learning Internship Tasks

This repository contains the tasks completed during my Machine Learning internship at **Encryptix**. My name is **Labiba Adinda Zahwana**, and throughout this internship, I applied machine learning techniques to various real-world problems, including data preprocessing, model development, training, evaluation, and results reporting. Each task is organized in separate directories and documented accordingly.

## Project Overview

The `Encryptix` repository showcases my work during my internship. It includes code and reports for various machine learning tasks, such as image classification, NLP text classification, and predictive analytics. This repository demonstrates my ability to work with different machine learning models, data types, and evaluation techniques.

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Image Classification
**Objective:** Build a machine learning model to classify images using [Dataset Name].
- **Directory:** `/task1_image_classification/`
- **Steps:**
  1. Data Preprocessing: Load and clean the dataset, apply augmentations, and split into training and test sets.
  2. Model Training: Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras.
  3. Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

### Task 2: NLP Text Classification
**Objective:** Develop a natural language processing (NLP) model to classify text data.
- **Directory:** `/task2_nlp_classification/`
- **Steps:**
  1. Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, removing stop words, and converting text into numerical features (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, etc.).
  2. Model Training: Train a text classifier using algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, or neural networks.
  3. Model Evaluation: Assess performance with metrics like F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.

### Task 3: Predictive Analytics
**Objective:** Create a regression model to predict sales/prices based on historical data.
- **Directory:** `/task3_predictive_analytics/`
- **Steps:**
  1. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, feature selection, and scaling.
  2. Model Training: Build a regression model using linear regression, decision trees, or random forest.
  3. Model Evaluation: Evaluate using RMSE, MAE, and R^2.
